## React Demonstration project

A baseline project with a series of tasks to increase familiarity with React technology, specifically:

* Stateful components
* TSX markup and `render()`
* Component lifecycle:
  * `componentDidMount()`
  * `componentShouldUpdate()` / `componentWillUpdate()`
  * `componentWillUnmount()`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. In the root directory, execute `npm install`
3. To build and run the project, execute `npm run start`

## Goals

1. To create components that respond to changes in state
2. To enact changes of state from user input
3. To enact changes of state from external events
